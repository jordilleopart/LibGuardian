# LibGuardian - Smart Library Monitoring System

## 📚 Introduction

LibGuardian is an intelligent Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) designed to monitor noise levels and occupancy in library environments. The system provides real-time insights into library conditions, helping staff maintain optimal study environments and enabling students to find quieter spaces.

### Why LibGuardian?

Libraries are meant to be quiet, focused spaces for learning and research. However, managing noise levels and occupancy across different areas can be challenging for library staff. LibGuardian addresses this by:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of noise levels and people count
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Historical analysis to identify patterns and peak usage times
- **Staff Alerts**: Automated notifications when areas become too noisy or crowded
- **Student Benefits**: Live data access to help students find optimal study spots
- **Scalable Design**: Easily expandable to monitor multiple rooms and floors

### Key Features

- 🔊 **Noise Level Monitoring**: Real-time sound measurement with decibel conversion
- 👥 **Occupancy Tracking**: Smart entry/exit detection using ultrasonic sensors
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**: Beautiful Grafana visualizations with live data updates
- 🌐 **Wireless Communication**: Multiple protocols (Wi-Fi, MQTT, NullNet)
- 💾 **Data Storage**: MySQL database for historical analysis
- 🔄 **Real-time Processing**: Node-RED for seamless data flow management

## 🏗️ System Architecture

LibGuardian consists of several interconnected components:

### Hardware Components
- **Grove Sound Sensor**: Measures ambient noise levels
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors**: Detect people entering/exiting (2 sensors per door)
- **Arduino Board**: Main processing unit for sound sensor
- **ESP32-S2**: Wireless data transmission for proximity sensors
- **OpenMote**: Wireless bridge for Arduino sensor data
- **Zolertia Board**: Central receiver and data aggregator

### Software Stack
- **Node-RED**: Data flow orchestration and processing
- **MySQL**: Persistent data storage and analytics
- **HiveMQ**: MQTT broker for real-time communication
- **Grafana**: Interactive dashboards and data visualization

### Communication Flow
1. Sensors collect noise and proximity data
2. Data transmitted wirelessly via MQTT/NullNet protocols
3. Node-RED processes and stores data in MySQL
4. Grafana displays real-time dashboards
5. System calculates occupancy and noise trends
